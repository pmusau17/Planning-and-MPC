# Planning-and-MPC

Let's see what we can learn about MPC and RRT*. 

This repository assumes that you have this [repo](https://github.com/pmusau17/Platooning-F1Tenth) cloned and built. You can either install it on your host or run it using docker. The dockerfiles and instructions for getting everything setup can be found a the above link. I will try and make sure that everything in this repository can be run through a container. Mostly this reposityory will contain implementations of planning algorithms and model predictive control regimes as I learn them. The idea is to write tutorials as I go. If I haven't done this when you arrive please remind me :).

# RRT*:

Rapidly exploring random trees (RRTs) are a family of algorithms designed to efficiently search high-dimensional spaces by randomly building a space filling tree. The tree is constructed incrementally from samples drawn randomly from the search space and is inherently biased to grow towards large unsearched areas of the configuration space (robot's world). A great introduction to these algorithms can be found in the following [paper](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/cs287-fa19/optreadings/rrtstar.pdf). In this paper, Sertac Karaman et al. proposed a new variant of RRT which had  RRTâˆ— that has shown to be computationally efficient and possesses probabilistic completeness guarantees. The approach is also asymptotically optimal. What does that mean? An algorithm is said to be complete if it terminates in finite time, returning a valid solution if one exists, and failure otherwise. In this case, it will find a path if one exists, and the asymptotic optimality piece guarantees that eventually (asymptotically) the algorithm will find the shortest path between the start point and goal point that defines the planning problem. If you are like me then this becomes more clear with pictures and an underlying implementation. You can find two different implmentations of the rrt* algorithm in the [rrt_star](rrt_star/) and [rrt_star_ros](rrt_star_ros)  directories. They were inspired (very similar) to the ones contained [here](https://github.com/zhm-real/PathPlanning) where you can find many more implementations of planning algorithms. The [rrt_star](rrt_star/) implementation using an explicit model of obstacles, while the latter [directory]([rrt_star_ros](rrt_star_ros)) does the planning over an occupancy grid. Below are gifs that show planning over the occupancy grid.

# Rsband Local Planner + Pure Pursuit

The rsband_local_planner combines an elastic band planner, a reeds shepp planner and a fuzzy logic based path tracking controller, to achieve reactive local planning for Car-Like robots with Ackermann or 4-Wheel-Steering. Originally proposed by [George Kouros](https://github.com/gkouros/rsband_local_planner)

# Building the Docker Container For This Repo

```
$ ./build_docker.sh
```

Start the container by running: 

```
$ ./run_docker.sh
```

In the terminal launched by run_docker.sh, the first thing you will do is build the ros packages.

```
$ source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash && catkin_make 
```


The next thing to do is Launch the [F1Tenth Simulator](https://github.com/pmusau17/Platooning-F1Tenth): 

If you have the docker image built run the following:


```
$ ./run_docker_simulator.sh
```
Then run: 
```
$ source devel/setup.bash && roslaunch race move_base_planning.launch
```

This should bring up a simulation of a racecar and some cones placed randomly throughout the racetrack. 

In the first docker terminal run:

```
$ roslaunch rsband_local_planner move_base_planning.launch
```

This should launch the following rviz window:

In the above gif, the plans are generated using the rsband local planner proposed by [George Kouros](https://github.com/gkouros/rsband_local_planner) and tracked using a [pure pursuit controller](rsband_local_planner/scripts/pure_pursuit.py). The goals are sent by a node that is a rough implementation of a behaviorial layer. The idea here is that whenever the car gets within a 1 m radius of the goal point we say that the plan has been executed and send the next goal point. The behavioral node implementation node can be found [here](rsband_local_planner/scripts/behavioral_layer.py). The costmaps used throught the planning are updated using the vehicle's lidar sensor and make use of the [move_base](http://wiki.ros.org/move_base) ros package. The configuration files (these were a paaaaaaiiiiin) can be found [here](https://github.com/pmusau17/Planning-and-MPC/tree/main/rsband_local_planner/cfg).
